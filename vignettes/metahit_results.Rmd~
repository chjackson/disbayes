## Assumptions used for all diseases 

1. Constant case fatality for age 50 and below

2. Case fatality is a smooth spline function of age


## Alternative models


### Model for area dependence 

1. Independent, area-specific estimates

   explained in main disbayes vignette 

2. Hierarchical model 

   explained in hierarchical model vignette 


### Model for age dependence 

1. unrestricted and smooth, with constant below age 50 

2. non-decreasing and smooth, with constant below age 50 



## Assumptions that differ between diseases 

Because the amount of information varies between areas

Some areas there is insufficient information for meaningful estimates of case fatality.  This happens particularly at younger ages where the prevalence of the disease is low.


1. All diseases apart from liver, colon, lung cancer 

	* Independent, area-specific estimates work 

	* Hierarchical model also works and gives more precise estimates 

2. Stomach and liver cancer 

	* Independent, area-specific estimates don't work 

	* Hierarchical model works, showing the borrowing of information between areas. 

2. Lung/trachea/bronchus cancer 

    * Assuming that case fatality is a non-decreasing function of age 

    * Under this assumption, area-specific estimates and hierarchical model both work, and hierarchical model gives more precise estimates.

Do we also present the gender model here? 

stats paper will want it
